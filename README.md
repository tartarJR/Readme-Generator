# Readme-Generator

A tiny readme generator for my Hackerrank-Solutions repository.
Generates a README.md file with a title, explanation and table by iterating through Hackerrank-Solution packages.

# TODOS
This Readme-Generator provides limited solution since it only works for my Hackerrank-Solutions repo but I am planning on providing a more generic solution to generate README.md files.
